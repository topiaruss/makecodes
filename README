WHAT IS THIS?
=============

Call this a demo of qrcode generation in python.  I used it to create a batch
of QRcodes for a project. Feel free to modify the list of URLS, and use it for
your own purpose.

LICENSE?
========

GPL3, see the top of makecodes.py

INSTALL
=======

Either 

  $ easy_install qrcode
  $ easy_install PIL

Or 

  $ virtualenv .
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

and then run 

  $ python makecodes.py

Several output .png files will appear in the same directory you ran the program.

If you want another format, you can change 'png' in the line ...

       img.save('%s.png' % title)

to nominate .pdf, or .jpg output format.  Your platform may need support libraries
to create certain output formats.
